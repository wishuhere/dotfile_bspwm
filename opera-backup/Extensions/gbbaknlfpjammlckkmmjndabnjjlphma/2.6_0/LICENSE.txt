OF SOFTWARE, OR TO FONT SOFTWARE CONVERTED INTO OTHER FORMATS, WEB SITES,

limited warranty period you must return, at our expense, the Software and proof
of purchase to the location where you obtained it. If the functionalities of
the Software vary substantially from the agreed upon functionalities, BEHOLDER CORPORATION is
entitled -- by way of re-performance and at its own discretion -- to repair or
replace the Software. If this fails, you are entitled to a reduction of the
purchase price (reduction) or to cancel the purchase agreement (rescission).

Department.

time of entering into the purchase agreement in respect of damages caused by a
slightly negligent breach of a material contractual obligation and (ii) BEHOLDER CORPORATION
and its affiliates will not be liable for damages caused by a slightly
negligent breach of a non-material contractual obligation.

liability, in particular, to liability under the German Product Liability Act,
liability for assuming a specific guarantee or liability for culpably caused
personal injuries.
